# **Funnel SSH Honeypot 🛡️**  

An interactive SSH honeypot designed to trap malicious attackers by simulating a vulnerable SSH server. It logs login attempts, captures commands executed by attackers, and provides a fake shell environment to monitor their activities.  

## **🚀 Features**  
- **SSH Authentication Capture** – Logs all login attempts, including usernames and passwords.  
- **Fake Shell Environment** – Mimics a real Linux shell to deceive attackers.  
- **Command Logging** – Records executed commands in a structured format.  
- **Custom Fake Files** – Provides misleading files (e.g., `password_config`) to lure attackers.  
- **Tarpit Mode (Optional)** – Slows down attackers by delaying responses.

## **🛠️ Installation**  

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/honeypot.git
cd honeypot
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**  
Create a virtual environment and install required Python packages:  
```sh
python -m venv honeypot_env
source honeypot_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `honeypot_env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3️⃣ Generate SSH Keys**  
If you don’t have SSH keys in the `static/` folder, generate them:  
```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f static/server.key -N ""
```

---

## **🚀 Usage**  

### **Start the SSH Honeypot**  
Run the honeypot on port **2222**:  
```sh
python ssh_honeypot.py
```

### **Connect to the Honeypot** (for testing)  
In another terminal, try connecting using SSH:  
```sh
ssh -p 2222 admin@127.0.0.1
```

## **📜 Logging & Monitoring**  

- **Credential Logs (`audits.log`)** – Captures attacker IP, username, and password in a readable format.  
- **Command Logs (`funnel.log`)** – Logs all executed commands and responses.  

Example log entries:  
```sh
[INFO] 192.168.1.10 attempted login with username: admin, password: 1234
[INFO] 192.168.1.10 executed command: cat password_config
```
