A Python-based honeypot security project designed to deceive, log, and analyze unauthorized attackers and bots attempting to compromise a system.

## üìã Overview

HoneyPie mimics a vulnerable machine by providing fake SSH and HTTP services, allowing security researchers to monitor attacker behavior in a controlled environment. The project helps understand attack patterns, collect threat intelligence, and enhance security posture.

### Key Features

* **SSH Honeypot:** A fake SSH server that logs brute-force login attempts and executed commands
* **HTTP Honeypot:** A fake WordPress admin login page that captures attacker credentials and logs unauthorized access attempts
* **Logging & Analysis:** Stores attacker data, including IP addresses, credentials, and command execution history
* **Tarpit Mode:** Slows down attackers to waste their resources and discourage automated attacks
* **Web Dashboard (Optional):** A web-based UI for visualizing attack trends and analyzing collected data

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

HoneyPie is built using the following technologies and libraries:

| Component | Technology Used |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Programming Language** | Python (3.8+) |
| **SSH Honeypot** | Paramiko (SSH server emulation) |
| **HTTP Honeypot** | Flask (Fake WordPress Admin Panel) |
| **Logging & Storage** | JSON and log files |
| **Web Dashboard** | Flask + HTML/CSS (for data visualization) |
| **Security Analysis** | Attack logging, IP tracking |
| **Environment Management** | Virtual environment using `venv` |

## üöÄ Installation

To install and run HoneyPie, follow these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rudrakadel/HoneyPie.git
cd HoneyPie
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up a Virtual Environment

```sh
python -m venv honeypot_env
source honeypot_env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
honeypot_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Generate SSH Keys (For SSH Honeypot)

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f static/server.key -N ""
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Honeypot

#### SSH Honeypot (Fake SSH Server)

```sh
python honeypy.py -a 127.0.0.1 -p 2222 -u admin -w password --ssh
```

#### HTTP Honeypot (Fake Admin Panel)

```sh
python honeypy.py -a 127.0.0.1 -p 5000 --http
```

#### Web Dashboard (Optional - Attack Logs Visualization)

```sh
python web_app.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

### System Requirements

- ‚úÖ Python 3.8+
- ‚úÖ Linux/macOS/Windows environment (preferably a VM or isolated system)

### Python Dependencies (installed via `requirements.txt`)

- `paramiko` (SSH server emulation)
- `flask` (Web honeypot & dashboard)
- `requests` (HTTP request handling)
- `json` (For logging attack data)

To install all dependencies, run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Warnings

- **DO NOT** run HoneyPie on production systems or personal machines
- Always deploy in isolated environments (VM, container, etc.)
- Use at your own risk and responsibility
- Always follow local laws and regulations regarding honeypot deployment
